## Theory
 A formal language can be considered to be the media or the format used to convey information from a sender entity to the one that receives it. The usual components of a language are:
#### *The alphabet: Set of valid characters;
#### *The vocabulary: Set of valid words;
#### *The grammar: Set of rules/constraints over the language.
    Now these components can be established in an infinite amount of configurations, which actually means that whenever a language is being created, it's components should be selected in a way to make it as appropriate for it's use case as possible. Of course sometimes it is a matter of preference, that's why we ended up with lots of natural/programming/markup languages which might accomplish the same thing.

## Objectives:

*Discover what a language is and what it needs to have in order to be considered a formal one;

According to your variant number, get the grammar definition and do the following:

a. Implement a type/class for your grammar;

b. Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar;

c. Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;

d. For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;

## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

* If needed, screenshots.
