# Intro to formal languages. Regular grammars. Finite Automata.

### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: Muntean Daniel

## Theory
If needed, but it should be written by the author in her/his words.


## Objectives:

*Discover what a language is and what it needs to have in order to be considered a formal one;

According to your variant number, get the grammar definition and do the following:

a. Implement a type/class for your grammar;

b. Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar;

c. Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;

d. For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;

## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

* If needed, screenshots.
